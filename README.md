Prototype:
Easy-to-start tablet application and device that guides BLV users to museum exhibits and places them in a position where a photo is automatically taken
Every art piece would have a textured mat in front of it to indicate to the user that theyâ€™re in front of the piece 
AI processes photos and reads out alt text, long/artistic descriptions and asks the user for more input with voice commands
